									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I'm a second-year Astrophysics & Astronomy PhD student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at
									Michigan State University. I work in Dr. Joey Rodriguez's exoplanets group. My current interests are
									in the origins of "Hot Jupiters," a type of giant exoplanet that orbits extremely close to its host star.
								</p>
								<p>
									I grew up in the scorching desert of Arizona, where I went to Arizona State University. I graduated with a BS in
									Physics in May of 2021, shortly after publishing my first <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abcd41/pdf">paper</a>
									in <em>The Astrophysical Journal</em> about presolar stardust grains formed from the ejected material of supernovae.
									In the Summer of 2021, I stepped foot in Michigan for the first time and decided to call it my home.
								</p>
								<p>
									Outside of the world of science, I'm a huge fan of all things nature. When I'm not cooped up inside studying for classes
									or grading my students' labs, you might find me exploring the lakes and forests in the Lansing area. I'm also a big soccer
									fan and an avid reader, so if I'm not outside enjoying temperatures below 110&#8457, I might be cheering on Arsenal or
									reading a good sci-fi book.

									<h2>My Research</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									The first exoplanet ever discovered around a main sequence star in 1995 was a Hot Jupiter. The discovery
									shocked the planetary science and astronomy community at the time, as giant planets were not expected to be found
									so close to their host stars. This discovery launched a new field and along with it a host of unanswered questions.
									My research aims to answer perhaps the earliest of these questions
								</p>
								<p>
									I am currently working with Dr. Joey Rodriguez to confirm and characterize Hot Jupiters discovered by NASA's
									Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). In conjunction with the work of other researchers such as Sam Yee
									from Princeton, my goal is to build a magnitude-limited, complete sample of Hot Jupiters so that I can probe their
									origins. I am currently writing a paper which will announce the confirmation of ten new Hot Jupiters orbiting FGK
									stars. This paper will be the first in a series of several that will be necessary to construct this sample.
								</p>
								<p>
									The observations of my Hot Jupiter targets come from a variety of telescopes around the world. I am an active user
									of the SOAR 4-meter telescope in Chile and MSU's 0.6-meter campus telescope. Many of the observations that I use
									also come from undergraduate astronomy students in the MSU Observing Research Program (MORP). As a member of the
									TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP), I receive photometric and spectroscopic observations from many researchers
									internationally.
