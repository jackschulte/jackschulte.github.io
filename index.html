									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I'm a third-year Astrophysics & Astronomy PhD candidate in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at
									Michigan State University. I work in Dr. Joey Rodriguez's exoplanets group. My current interests are
									in the origins of "Hot Jupiters," a type of giant exoplanet that orbits extremely close to its host star.
								</p>
								<p>
									I grew up in the scorching desert of Arizona, where I went to Arizona State University. I graduated with a BS in
									Physics in May of 2021, shortly after publishing my first <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abcd41/pdf">paper</a>
									in <em>The Astrophysical Journal</em> about presolar stardust grains formed from the ejected material of supernovae.
									In the Summer of 2021, I stepped foot in Michigan for the first time and decided to call it my home.
								</p>
								<p>
									Outside of the world of science, I'm a huge fan of all things nature. When I'm not cooped up inside studying for classes
									or grading my students' labs, you might find me exploring the lakes and forests in the Lansing area. I'm also a big soccer
									fan and an avid reader, so if I'm not outside enjoying temperatures below 110&#8457, I might be cheering on Arsenal or
									reading a good sci-fi book.

									<h2>My Research</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									The first exoplanet ever discovered around a main sequence star in 1995 was a Hot Jupiter. The discovery
									shocked the planetary science and astronomy community at the time, as giant planets were not expected to be found
									so close to their host stars. This discovery launched a new field and along with it a host of unanswered questions.
									My research aims to answer perhaps the earliest of these questions.
								</p>
								<p>
									I am currently working with Dr. Joey Rodriguez to confirm and characterize Hot Jupiters discovered by NASA's
									Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). In conjunction with the work of other researchers such as Sam Yee
									from Princeton, my goal is to build a magnitude-limited, complete sample of Hot Jupiters so that I can probe their
									origins. I am currently writing a paper which will announce the confirmation of ten new Hot Jupiters orbiting FGK
									stars. This paper will be the first in a series of several that will be necessary to construct this sample.
								</p>
								<p>
									The observations of my Hot Jupiter targets come from a variety of telescopes around the world. I am an active user
									of the SOAR 4-meter telescope in Chile and MSU's 0.6-meter campus telescope. Many of the observations that I use
									also come from undergraduate astronomy students in the MSU Observing Research Program (MORP). As a member of the
									TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP), I receive photometric and spectroscopic observations from many researchers
									internationally.

									<h2>My Outreach Efforts</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I am currently heavily involved with the MSU Observing Research Program (MORP), a team of MSU astronomy undergraduates
									that use the MSU Observatory's 0.6-meter telescope to confirm the existence of transiting exoplanets and observe
									bright variable stars. I work with the MORP undergraduates to provide them with high-priority planet candidates,
									analyze the observations, and to write my own paper on several planets observed by MORP. MORP students have recently
									co-authored several planet and brown dwarf discovery papers as a result of their observations. If you are an MSU
									undergraduate and would like to join MORP or if you are a member of the community that would like to donate to or
									otherwise support the MSU Observatory or MORP, please contact me, <a href="mailto:chomiukl@msu.edu">Dr. Laura Chomiuk</a>,
									or <a href="mailto:jrod@msu.edu">Dr. Joey Rodriguez</a>.

								<p>
									I also help to run the twice-a-month public observing nights at the MSU Observatory. At each of these events, we open
									our doors to the astronomy-curious public and offer guests the chance to look through our 0.6-m telescope and learn
									about the history of the MSU Observatory. We also set up smaller telescopes in the parking lot of the observatory and
									welcome our guests to ask questions of the local astronomers in attendance. For more information about our public observing
									nights, please visit the Abrams Planetarium's <a href="https://www.abramsplanetarium.org/Programs/PublicObserving.html">website</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									Starting in Spring 2023, I will be launching a new talk series at the MSU Observatory, titled <em>All Walks of Astronomy</em>.
									These talks will happen on public observing nights and will be given by a wide array of astronomers, from undergraduates and
									amateur astronomers to professional astronomers and astronomy faculty. These talks will be accompanied by short presentations
									about how to get involved with astronomy at the amateur, undergraduate, and graduate level.
								</p>
								<p>
									There are plenty of other ways to get involved with astronomy in Lansing! Come grab a drink and see me and other local astronomers
									speak about fun astronomy topics at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AoTLansing">Astronomy on Tap Lansing</a>!
